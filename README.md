# TKLTA Idioms Sentence Embeddings

This repository contains pre-computed sentence embeddings for idioms across many languages. Each JSON file stores 30 idiomatic sentences from a single language mapped to 768‑dimensional vectors. These embeddings were generated by Talkalotta and distributed as part of the **Talkalotta Corpora** under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 License (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)).

## Repository Layout

- **JSON files** &ndash; 50 files named `TKLTA_<LANG>_10_IDI_AN_MBDS.json` where `<LANG>` denotes a language or locale code. Each file is a dictionary whose keys are idiomatic sentences and whose values are arrays of 768 floating‑point numbers representing the corresponding embedding.
- **LICENSE** &ndash; license terms (CC BY-SA 4.0).

## Example

A snippet from `TKLTA_USEN_10_IDI_AN_MBDS.json` illustrates the data structure:

```json
{
    "I didn’t want to get the surgery, but I had to bite the bullet.": [
        -0.18888843059539795,
        0.3449137508869171,
        -0.9430605173110962,
        ...,
        -0.43210023641586304
    ]
}
```

## Using the Embeddings

```python
import json

with open("TKLTA_USEN_10_IDI_AN_MBDS.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
    data = json.load(f)

sentence = "I didn’t want to get the surgery, but I had to bite the bullet."
vector = data[sentence]  # list of 768 floats
```
